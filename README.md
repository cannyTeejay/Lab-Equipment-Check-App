# Lab-Equipment-Check-App
This is a simple Android app built using Jetpack Compose. It allows users to check whether a laboratory has enough computers for a given number of students. The user inputs the number of computers and students, and the app provides a result indicating if the lab is suitable for a test or if additional computers are needed.
